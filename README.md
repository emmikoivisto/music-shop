# music-shop

This is a model of a music shop I made for practicing the use of interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism. 
The music shop includes instruments (abstract class), which includes a couple different types of instruments (inheritance).
The program has two interfaces, ISell and IPlay. Instruments can be played, and the can be Sold in the Shop (polymorphism and interfaces).
